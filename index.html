                The Tesla Model X is a mid-size all-electric luxury SUV made by Tesla, Inc. The vehicle is notable in
                that it uses falcon-wing doors for passenger access.

                The Model X was developed from the full-sized sedan platform of the Tesla Model S. The Model X has an
                EPA size class as an SUV, and shares ~30% of its content with the Model S, half of the originally
                planned ~60%, and weighs about 10 percent more. Both the Model X and Model S are being produced at the
                Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. The prototype was unveiled at Tesla's design studios in Hawthorne,
                California on February 9, 2012. First deliveries of the Model X began in September 2015.
                After one full year on the market, in 2016, the Model X ranked seventh among the world's best-selling
                plug-in cars.

                As of February 14, 2020, the Model X is only available as the Long Range Plus with an estimated EPA
                range of 351 miles (565 km) and the Performance model with an estimated EPA range of 305 miles (491 km).
